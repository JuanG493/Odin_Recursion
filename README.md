# Odin_Recursion
Practice for recursion using fibonacci and merge sort

Tasks:
- Using iteration, write a function fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence
- write function fibsRec which solves the same problem recursively.
- Build a function mergeSort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
